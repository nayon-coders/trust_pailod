# TrustPilot Review Scraper

This script extracts reviews from TrustPilot and saves them into a MySQL database. The table name in the database is dynamically set based on the name of the CSV file containing the URLs to be scraped.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **MySQL**: Install MySQL and set up a database. You can download it from [mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/).
3. **Selenium WebDriver**: Download the Chrome WebDriver from [chromedriver.chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).
4. **Python Packages**: Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install selenium mysql-connector-python
    ```

## Configuration

### Step 1: Update the `details.py` Script

1. **WebDriver Path**: Change the `webdriver_path` variable to the path where you have saved the Chrome WebDriver executable on your machine.
    ```python
    webdriver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver'
    ```

2. **MySQL Configuration**: Update the `mysql_config` dictionary with your MySQL username, password, host, and database name.
    ```python
    mysql_config = {
        'user': 'your_mysql_username',
        'password': 'your_mysql_password',
        'host': 'localhost',
        'database': 'your_database_name'
    }
    ```

3. **CSV File Path**: When running the script, provide the path to your CSV file as a command-line argument.

### Step 2: Running the Script

To run this you can click the run button of visual studio code or pycharme.

or if you used app.py to use the api endpoint hit this url into your browser,
**http://localhost:5000/scrape?category=Bank&location=Berlin**

## Logging

The script will log its progress and any errors encountered. This information can be helpful for debugging if something goes wrong.

## Additional Information

- **Search Name**: If you need to change the search criteria or add additional logic for extracting reviews, you can modify the `extract_reviews` function in the script.

## Troubleshooting

- **MySQL Connection Issues**: Ensure that MySQL is running and the credentials provided in `mysql_config` are correct.
- **WebDriver Issues**: Ensure that the Chrome WebDriver version matches your installed Chrome browser version.
- **Dependencies**: Make sure all required Python packages are installed.
